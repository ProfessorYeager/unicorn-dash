# Unicorn Dash 🦄💨

A web-based infinite runner inspired by Geometry Dash, built in roughly 20 minutes (with some polish later!) to prove a point.

## The Story 📖

This project started from a conversation with one of my high school students. I caught him playing Geometry Dash instead of working on his Python assignment. To keep it light, I asked: **"Why play a game like that when you could be making one?"**

He replied, *"I'm not a developer. I don't know how to do that, and I don't have a whole dev team at my disposal."*

Challenge accepted. 🤝

I told him that using AI (AntiGravity/Gemini), I could build a working version of Geometry Dash before the bell rang—about 20 minutes. I asked the class for a theme, and naturally, high schoolers chose **Unicorns with a Cat Head player**. 🐱🦄

By the end of class, we had a running game. With a little extra polish between blocks and the following morning, this is the result.

## The Purpose 🚀

This isn't about showing off coding skills. It's about **Growth Mindset**.

Refrain from saying *"I'm not X"* or *"I can't do Y"*. instead, have the confidence that by utilizing modern tools (AI), applying base logic, and remaining persistent, you can build just about anything.

We live in exciting times. The only limitations are your creative problem solving, your perspective, and your willingness to try.

## How to Play 🎮

*   **Jump**: Spacebar, Arrow Up, or Click anywhere.
*   **Goal**: Dodge the spikes and get the highest score!
*   **Difficulty**: Speed increases every 100 points. Good luck!

## Tech Stack 🛠️

*   **Engine**: Vanilla JavaScript (HTML5 Canvas)
*   **Assets**: AI Generated
*   **Assistant**: AntiGravity / Gemini
